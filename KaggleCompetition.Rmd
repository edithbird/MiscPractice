In 2015 Instacart had 206,209 customers place 3,421,083 orders  




```{r}
#m is c with the NA omitted. The NA is their first order. So there are actually no NA values. This can be deduced from the summary. 
m <- c %>% na.omit()
dim(m)
ggplot(c,aes(x = factor(days_since_prior_order))) + geom_bar()
byCustomerOrder <- m %>% group_by(user_id) %>% summarise(numberOrders = n())
summary(byCustomerOrder)

sum(is.na(c))
head(c, 25)
summary(c)
summary(m)

```


```{r}
sampleUsers <- sample_n(m, 10)

```


Want to make an interactive dataset where a customer's activity can be isolated from the others and it will show all of their orders. 


for(i in unique(UniqueData$State)){
  
  
  newDS <- UniqueData %>% filter(State == i)
  
  print(head(newDS))
  hist(newDS$Number.of.Prescriptions, main = paste(i, "'s Rx Frequency"))
  identify(newDS$Number.of.Prescriptions)
  
}

```{r}
# User_ID <- unique(m$user_id)
# for(i in 1:length(m$user_id)){
#   newDSm <- m[m$user_id == UserID[i],]
#   identity(newDSm$days_since_prior_order)
#   
#   
# }
```

206209 user_id
```{r}
users_split <- split(sampleUsers, sampleUsers$user_id)
length(users_split)
names <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "none", "ten")
head(names)

for (i in 1:length(users_split)) {
  assign(names[i], users_split[[i]])

###Number of times each product is entered in the dataset

There are 32,434,489 entries in this dataset. There are 49,667 items that get reordered. 



```{r}
XX <- X %>% group_by(product_id) %>% summarise(countEntries = n()) %>% arrange(desc(countEntries))
mean(XX$countEntries)
head(XX)
dim(XX)
49667/32434489
```


###Number of times product was reordered. 

```{r}
XXX <- X %>% group_by(product_id) %>% summarise(countReordered = sum(reordered)) %>% arrange(countReordered)
head(XXX)
dim(XXX)
```

###Percent of reorders per item

First join the precious 2 tables to put the number of entries and the number of times an entry was reordered side by side. 

```{r}
XXXX <- inner_join(XX, XXX)
head(XXXX)
dim(XXXX)
```

Which products never got reordered?
There were 4,372 items that were never reordered. 

```{r}
neverReordered <- XXX %>% filter(countReordered == 0)
dim(neverReordered)
head(neverReordered)
```


```{r}
XXXXX <- XXXX %>% mutate(PercentReordered = countReordered/countEntries) %>% arrange(desc(PercentReordered))
head(XXXXX)
dim(XXXXX)
```

Distribution of reorders

```{r}
head(XXXXX)
boxplot(XXXXX$PercentReordered, ylab = "Percent of items reordered", main = "Spread of Reorders")

hist(XXXXX$PercentReordered, xlab = "Percentage of items that are reordered", ylab = "Frequency of reorders", main = "Frequency Distribution of Items Reordered")
```


Which products were reordered over 80% of the time?

```{r}
XXXXXX <- XXXXX %>% filter(PercentReordered >= 0.8)
dim(XXXXXX)
head(XXXXXX)
```

###What percent of products were reordered over 80 percent of the time?

```{r}
round(dim(XXXXXX)/dim(XXXXX), digits = 3)
```
Product Names

```{r}
Products <- read.csv("products.csv", header = T)
head(Products)
dim(Products)
```

###What are the products that were reordered over 80% of the time?


```{r}
XXXXXXX <- inner_join(Products, XXXXXX)
kable(head(XXXXXXX %>% arrange(desc(countReordered))))
head(XXXXXXX)
```
